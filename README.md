# Stock-Data-Analysis_with_Risk-and-Value-Prediction
The stock market has always been a fascinating topic for me. And recently I wanted to learn more about them. So I tried to write a program where I could analyze all the data of any stock I want.
After researching about the deciding factors for the market I came to conclusion that quantitative analysis of any stock involves comparing risk measures such as alpha, beta, r-squared, standard deviation, adjacent closing price and moving average.
Thus, this project entails the quantitative analysis of any stock ticker of our choice from given time period (user can input any time period of its choice) to better understand the stock flow in the market, its correlativity and codependency on a list of predefined famous stock (user can also add stocks of its own liking).
To add on to the QA (quantitative analysis) I also added a prediction model which will train on the previous data taken from yahoo finance and alpha vantage to predict the stockâ€™s closing price on30th day with 97.4%accuracy.
As the trend of the stock market is inconsistent and looks random to normal people, Machine learning is a great way for normal people or beginners to predict accurately. 
The mentioned model is a neural network in Tenserflow and keras, more specifically I built a recurrent neural network with LSTM cells
